# Food-Per-Gram-iOSApp
## iOS Application for food Blogging similar to Instagram
### The project is Food-Recipe App will be build from Open APIs - “THE MEAL DB”
Users will be able to sign-up and login and will be able to save and delete recipes from their save tab, this will ease their way of cooking.
### The App includes different categories of Recipes which are displayed and pulled directly from an Open-Api
